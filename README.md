**Gamercade.c3** is a [C3](https://c3-lang.org/) binding for the [Gamercade - A Neo-Retro Fantasy Console](https://gamercade.io/) that runs on WASM roms. While not your *every day* binding, this repository holds the binding itself and instructions how to set it up.

Gamercade does not have any dependencies when using it with C3! All you need to do is write your code with a language that just fits the fantasy console like it meant to be, build and enjoy!
