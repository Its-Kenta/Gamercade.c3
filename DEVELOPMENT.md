## Summary

**Gamercade.c3** will continue getting updates as the Gamercade API continues to expand, this is a great fantasy console to create small projects to learn about the fantasy console itself, but also C3 which feels like a perfect match made in heaven for Gamercade!


## Roadmap

None. This binding only follows the API provided by Gamercade and won't be expanding anything further.

## Known Issues

None as of yet.
